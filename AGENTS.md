This is a rust project implementing a sandboxed LLM agent.

- Be resourceful about commands with long output.
  Use head, tail, grep etc. and check file sizes before checking their full contents.
- Comments and commit messages should explain "why", not "what".
  Don't paraphrase code next to the comment.
- Format, run tests before committing.
